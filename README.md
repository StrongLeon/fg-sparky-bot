# hi chat
this is the source code for the very work in progress fg sparky discord bot.

the fg sparky "bot" is a game made by [stella](https://www.youtube.com/@WTIF2025). the goal is to guess an fg number based on its symbol.

this is (presumably) inspired by the gd sparky bot, a game where you have to guess a geometry dash level based on a screenshot of the level.
